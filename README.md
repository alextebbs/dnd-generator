### TODO

### High

- Make Auth actually protect characters that aren't yours
- Mobile UI (sidebar needs to toggle)
- Its slow :(
- Relational stuff is still messed up
  - Goals don't know about other goals when they are generated
  - Friends/Enemies is giving 6 of each
- You should be able to create a character without a login, and then associate that character with your login (???)

### Mid

- Images need to actually get stored somewhere, unfortunately
- Sort out prompts, add examples, tune them
- Use Existing Data? checkbox currently does nothing
- Reroll doesn't do anything
- Use this? https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-the-vercel-ai-sdk

### Low

- Consider a more robust dithering effect on photo?
- Look into next/font
