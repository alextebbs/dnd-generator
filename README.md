### TODO

- Look into next/font
- Make Auth actually protect characters that aren't yours
- Dithering effect on photo?
- Images need to actually get stored somewhere, unfortunately
- You should be able to create a character without a login, and then associate that character with your login (???)
- Mobile UI (sidebar needs to toggle)
- Sort out prompts, add examples, tune them
- Its slow :(
- https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-the-vercel-ai-sdk
- Use Existing Data? checkbox currently does nothing
- Reroll doesn't do anything

- Relational stuff is still messed up
  - Goals don't know about other goals when they are generated
  - Friends/Enemies is giving 6 of each
